# Multi-Layer Neural Network

A simple implementation of a feedforward neural network trained using
backpropagation and gradient descent.

## Model
- Architecture: 128 → 64 → 32
- Task: Classification
- Accuracy: ~93%

## Key Learnings
- Data normalization significantly improved convergence
- Learning rate tuning mattered more than adding layers
- Deeper networks overfit without proper regularization
